== Description ==

Cache for widgets.

- Provides a checkbox to indicate if a widget should be cached. 
- Default is no caching.
- Caches the widget for 12 mins... which doesn't seem to be enough to make it worthwhile.

**"the oik plugin - for often included key-information"**

oik-widget-cache is based on the widget-output-cache plugin by Kaspars Dambis ( @kasparsd ).
It was forked from version 0.5.1. It reverses the logic for determining which widgets should be cached.
